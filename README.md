# Brewery-Project
Group Names: Eric Morales and Rafael Basurto

Description: 
This project will be a simulation of a brewing company, the brewery will have a  variety of beers with different features (alcohol percentage, type of beer (IPA, Stout, HefeWeizen,etc) and sizes available (in ounces). Nebula Brewing will have a happy hour all day Mondays and Wednesdays for all customers who come in. The staff will include bartenders, brewers, and the user interface will be the manager and\or supervisor. The simulation will go through each week with events having people come to the brewery and drinking. As the manager you will choose whether you want to fire or give second chances to employees who make mistakes. You will also be able to add new beers to the menu or get rid of certain beers if they're not selling enough or if you would just like to try adding a new beer to the menu. The restaurant will also have different events to bring in more customers and revenue to the budget. 

Coderunner was also used to run the code.
